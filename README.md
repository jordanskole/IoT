# Projects

This is a repository for all the different projects that I would like to work on. 

## IoT

These are the notes on my IoT projects, and any dashboards that belong to them. If you have an idea, or a comment, create an [issue](https://github.com/jordanskole/IoT/issues).

* [**Bus Stop Blinkers**](#) - LED indicators that signal if a bus is X, 5, or 1 minute from the stop. Solar power + 3G connectivity. Utilize the secret and buried [DDOT Real Time Data API](http://ddot-beta.herokuapp.com/api/api/where/vehicles-for-agency/DDOT.json?key=LIVEMAP). Thanks Adam! 
* [**Electric Cruiser**](#) - Frame built by [Go Cruiser Go](https://www.facebook.com/goCRUISERgo/). A true showpiece. 
* [**Mailbox**](#) - can tell if there is mail, or if the postal worker has visited, and if there is mail in the mailbox
* [**Grocery Buttons/Kitchen Switches**](#) - A WiFi connected device, (similar to the Amazon Button) that populates a grocery list from simple button press. For example, you could have 9 buttons of perishables (milk, eggs, juice, lunch meat, bread). Press the bread button? Add bread to the grocery list + red LED. Buy bread and mark complete in app? Kitchen Switch goes green. Press the bread button again (while green) Removes bread from list. 
* [**Maggy Plant**](https://github.com/jordanskole/IoT/tree/master/maggyplant) - Logs data about Heather and my plant; Maggy Plant. Temp, ambient light, soil moisture, humidity. Save notes about the plant's health. Indoor version of [Costa Rica Weather Station](#). 
* [**Washing Machine Attachment/Puck**](#) - can tell if the washer/dryer has finished
* [**Keychain/Racks**](#) - can tell who is home (or at least what cars). Requires people hang keys on hooks.
* [**Jarvis**](#) - Voice recognition. Can tell you information about your house, adjust the thermostat, etc. See the [ASK](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service)
* [**Ambassagong**](#) - A device that rings a gong, when you press a [RESTful] "button" on the internet. 
* [**Stats Tracker**](#) - A wearable BLE sticker that gathers a player's location data from a standard-size field (like a basketball court). 
* [**Message in a Bottle**](#) - A small orb that floats. Throw it in the ocean, and it collects and logs environmental data.
* [**Costa Rica Weather Station**](#) - A multi-environmental sensor that communicates over 3G. Simply unfold the solar panel, stick the moisture sensor in the soil, and it begins broadcasting.
* [**Who's Home?**](#) - Like the Keychain/Racks, only uses a Bluetooth basestation and phones or small sensors like [Tiles](#) to determine who's home.
* [**Train Crossing Monitor**](#) - Solar/3G device that broadcasts when a train is crossing an intersection. Test in downtown Royal Oak. _note: what if the train is stopped at an intersection?_
* [**Wifi/3G Meat Thermometer**](#) - A meat thermometer that broadcasts the temperature of my dad's smoker. Thanks Henry! 
* [**Blimp Drone**](#) - Floats up via a string, and stays aimed at the HS field to get aerial drone shots of the game. Thanks Kevin! 
* [**Roswell**](#) - Weather ballon that captures weather data (temp, altitude, humidity, gps position) and broadcasts it back to earth via 3G [_note: maybe use xbee 40 mile?_]. Start with fishing line leash, eventually let that fella loose!.
* [**Air Quality Sensor**](#) - For the basement of my cousin's "Man Cave."
* [**Polar/Desert Drone**](#) - [This chassis](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12719), plus [this com](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13745) platform. 
* [**Foo Bartender**](#) - A [robotic desktop arm](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13663) for mixing cocktails from a preset menu. 

## Software as a Service

* [**Mo' Money**](#) - A payments gateway for my uncle Morris (Mo) to process payments for his soccer club Vardar. 
* [**Wine Cellar**](#) - A repository for kit "wineries" to keep track of their concurrent brews.
* [**Detroit Grand Prix**](#) - A race video game where you race around Detroit. Built in Unity3d.
* [**Freshman**](#) - A map of the most popular college campuses in the united states, with assignments on how to get around. So that foreign students can learn their way around before their first day on campus. 
* [**Your Idea Here!**](#) - If you have an idea for a piece of software or an application you would like to see built, I would be happy to consider it.
