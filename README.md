# IoT

This is a repository to store notes on my IoT projects, and any dashboards that belong to them. If you have an idea, or a comment, create an [issue](https://github.com/jordanskole/IoT/issues).

## Projects

* [Mailbox](#) - can tell if there is mail, or if the postal worker has visited, and if there is mail in the mailbox
* [Washing Machine Attachment/Puck](#) - can tell if the washer/dryer has finished
* [Keychain/Racks](#) - can tell who is home (or at least what cars). Requires people hang keys on hooks.
* [Jarvis](#) - Voice recognition. Can tell you information about your house, adjust the thermostat, etc. See the [ASK](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service)
* [Ambassagong](#) - A device that rings a gong, when you press a [RESTful] "button" on the internet. 
* [Stats Tracker](#) - A wearable BLE sticker that gathers a player's location data from a standard-size field (like a basketball court). 
* [Message in a Bottle](#) - A small orb that floats. Throw it in the ocean, and it collects and logs environmental data.
* [Costa Rica Weather Station](#) - A multi-environmental sensor that communicates over 3G. Simply unfold the solar panel, stick the moisture sensor in the soil, and it begins broadcasting.
* [Who's Home?](#) - Like the Keychain/Racks, only uses a Bluetooth basestation and phones or small sensors like [Tiles](#) to determine who's home.
* [Train Crossing Monitor](#) - Solar/3G device that broadcasts when a train is crossing an intersection. Test in downtown Royal Oak. _note: what if the train is stopped at an intersection?_
* [Wifi/3G meet thermometer](#) - A meat thermometer that broadcasts the temperature of my dad's smoker. Thanks Henry! 
* [Blimp Drone](#) - Floats up via a string, and stays aimed at the HS field to get aerial drone shots of the game. Thanks Kevin!
